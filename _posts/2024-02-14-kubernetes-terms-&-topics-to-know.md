I've finally taken the helm in hand.    
Well, for the moment I don't know where it's going to take me.   
The waves are still pretty choppy, but I'm staying on course. 


Yes finally, I'm learning <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>.


I have the goal to pass the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator** (<a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/" target="_blank">CKA</a>) in the following months.  
And goodness there is plenty to learn !   
But I like it, it's very refreshing and satisfying to update my skills.
